# **App Name**: Soundscape Mixer

## Core Features:

- Sound Selection: Allow users to select from a range of ambient sounds: rain, campfire, train, wind, thunderstorm. Support the ability to add more sounds later using a configuration.
- Volume Control: Provide sliders for each sound to control the volume individually.
- Sound Looping: Automatically loop the sounds for continuous playback.
- AI-Powered Soundscapes: Use AI to analyze user's current environment (using a prompt from the user describing what they are doing) and suggest the best soundscape for focus, relaxation, or sleep. The LLM acts as a tool to use the environmental description in order to determine whether or not certain soundscapes are suggested to the user.
- Play/Pause Control: Offer a global play/pause button to control all sounds simultaneously.
- Sound Animations: Link the animation of the sounds, to the sounds being played, so if a soundscape is in use, and individual sounds are in use, those individual sound components have their own animations. If an individual animation component is disabled, or the sound has the value of zero, then don't animate that individual element

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of calm and relaxation.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), close in hue to the primary color, to create a dark color scheme that is gentle on the eyes.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA), analogous to the primary color but much brighter and desaturated, to highlight interactive elements.
- Secondary accent color: Gold (#FFD700) to add a touch of luxury and sophistication, used sparingly for key interactive elements.
- Tertiary color: Dark teal (#008080) to provide a complementary contrast, used for subtle UI elements and dividers.
- Font: 'Literata', a serif font, for a relaxing and vintage feel that suits the purpose of the app.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons for sound controls.
- Arrange sound controls in a clear, intuitive manner, with prominent play/pause button.
- Incorporate subtle, soothing animations, such as gentle pulsing or swaying, synchronized to the soundscapes.
